Caravan is a set of in-process event streaming tools for [Go](https://golang.org/) applications. Think ["Kafka"](https://kafka.apache.org), but for the internal workings of your software. Caravan Essentials includes basic features for managing Topics, including their Producers and Consumers.

_This is a work in progress. The basics are there, but not yet ready for production use. Use at your own risk_
